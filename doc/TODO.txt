1. Add the Release action. 
On p. 258 the Release action is mentioned as one of the possible actions in the wumpus world. This action, as described on
http://www.cis.temple.edu/~ingargio/cis587/readings/wumpus.shtml, allows the agent to release an object it is holding.

Minor issues:
a. Rename Project WumpusEnvironment to WumpusWorld; rename wumpusenv.jar to WumpusWorld.jar.
